    <p>When I first discovered Pilates as a form of exercise for me; I didn’t realize how versatile Pilates is a way to become fit. I had read that Pilates could strengthen my core and increase my balance; which my body desperately needed. I didn’t know it has other benefits, as well. It helps to improve one’s posture; it can decrease back pain (which I can certainly attest to that fact.) It helps to prevent further injuries (of which I have brought on a few injuries to my aging body.) It increases one’s energy and enhances body awareness, making a body, mind, spirit connection. I actually look forward to doing Pilates every week. I can’t say that about other forms of exercise.
    </p><p>The first time I met Brooke Claveria 7 years ago, and she introduced me to Pilates; I knew I was entering a new adventure; making exercise fun and enjoyable. At first, when I initially saw the Reformer table, I thought it resembles a torture rack. But I have come to appreciate all of the different strengthening exercises and stretching that can be done, above and beyond what I can do on a mat and roller on the ground. I take private lessons from Brooke at her home studio once/week; and attend a Pilates class at Shoreline Park another day during the week. We use mats, rollers, bands and blocks to augment the exercise repertoire.
    </p><p>I heartedly recommend Brooke’s Pilates classes and private lessons. It is so worth what you put into it, as far as time and money. Try it and see for yourself.

    <blockquote>
    <p>Words cannot explain how much Brookilates has changed my perspective on my body and what it can do. I first met the amazing, focused and consistently professional Brooke in one of her group classes at Goleta Valley Athletic Club. Back in December of 2013, I decided to give 121 reformer sessions with her a go, however, I was not expecting much. After an hour session I was totally hooked and blown away! I couldn’t believe how after a simple hour my body felt more relaxed, more energized and completely at peace! Brooke is an extremely intuitive and attentive teacher…. She takes the passion and interest to learn your body during each individual reformer session so she will know how to make your body work the best it can strive to be.
    </p><p>I have been battling a chronic illness for the past 3.5 years without anything to help my consistent frustration. I have full belief that it is due to my Brookilates sessions that my health is slowly stabilizing. Pilates is not only an opportunity to work out and do core muscle work but also an exercise that connects the physical and the mental energies together. It has taught me to listen to my body more and I notice that it has helped my illness be less volatile and unpredictable. I can assure you I did not expect this outcome but fully rejoice in it.
    </p><p>I hope to continue with Pilates for life as it has made me a happier and more wholesome person. Pilates through the Brookilates method has changed my outlook on fitness and health.
    </p><p>Thank you Brookilates!!!! I hope you expand to the UK one day ;)

    <p>I always look forward to Pilates sessions with Brooke! I have trained with her on both the reformer and mat classes.
    </p><p>As an instructor, Brooke delivers clear instructions and explanations on how a certain exercise builds muscle and helps with overall coordination, posture and strength. She is able to provide succinct and non-technical explanations to my many questions on the impact of various exercises on the body and the accompanying stretches that one has to do after a certain exercise. She is also very helpful in suggesting variations of exercises that one can do without the reformer. Brooke is very perceptive during exercise, and knows when your core or a certain muscle is engaged (or not).
    </p><p>Overall, Brooke has a cheerful, energetic, encouraging yet patient disposition, which I think, is essential for a good and dedicated trainer. Brooke is the first person to introduce me to Pilates and I hope to be doing my 100s for many, many more years to come.

    <p> I've been a client of Brooke's for a little over a year now and I can definitely feel an improvement in flexibility, core strength and stability, and overall sports performance. My overall muscle tone and posture have definitely improved with the intricate movements that Brookilates provides. Thanks for the sexy abs Brooke.
