    <blockquote>
    The sun comes out and warms the earth, the sea gulls fly above, the waves crash forth upon the shore, the richness of the sea I smell as though I were beneath its swell, and all is peaceful mind and soul, and all is well my heart, my being, I could be young, I could be old, but all I know is I look hot in my bikini because I do brookilates three times a week for an hour in the evening.

    <h1>BE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW AFTER</h1>

    </span>

    <blockquote>
        Everyone has moments of despair with their workout plan, days when they use the holiday excuse for cheating on their diet, and times when life just gets challenging, but what kind of an example are we leaving for the next generation to follow? How are we living today that is affecting the choices our children, peers, and family members make?
        <br/><br/>The most important thing when it comes to fitness is not the diet or the fitness plan but what our lifestyle is preaching to others. Once these questions become in the forefront of our minds then true change can happen naturally and suddenly the diet and fitness plan become easier to accomplish.
        <br/><br/>The best motivation is when we take a look at ourselves through the lens of those who see us the most, because we don’t want to teach our children to fail, we don’t want our peers to find us unaccountable and deem us unfit to follow, and we want our family to rejoice in our accomplishments and our parents to boast in our triumphs.
        <br/><br/>I am not saying it is easy to be that leader toward a healthier lifestyle, I am merely explaining that it starts with a visual picture of where we are and what we are doing in the present state and how that present state we are in will affect our future. Therefore let us be a good example for those who follow after.

    </span>

    <blockquote>
    When I work with a client for the first time I usually start off by asking them what they think their "core" consists of. The most usual response I get is the abdominal muscles. While the abdominal muscles are a huge portion of the body's "core" muscles, they are only one part of them. In order to have a strong "core", we must strengthen the whole central part of the body including the back, sides, pelvic floor, chest, shoulder girdle, hips, and abdominals.
